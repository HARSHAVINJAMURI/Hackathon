## Problem statement 
Develop a nutrition-focused website providing personalized diet recommendations and health-related services, including diet planning, BMI calculation, and health issue-based food recommendations. Ensure the website offers a user-friendly interface and delivers tailored recommendations based on user preferences and health status. People with good knowledge of using technology can use this product.
## About the project
- Users can access detailed information about nutrition diet plans tailored to their needs. This includes explanations of various diet plans and recommendations for specific foods based on user-selected nutrition preferences.
- A BMI calculator should be provided where users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI value. The calculated BMI value should be displayed to the user.
- Health Issue-based Food Recommendations service should provide users with recommendations for foods based on their health issues. Users can access information about common health issues related to food and receive personalized recommendations to address their specific health concerns.
## Target Audience
- Individuals seeking personalized nutrition guidance and diet planning.
- Health-conscious individuals interested in monitoring their BMI and receiving health-related recommendations.
- Users with specific health issues looking for dietary recommendations to improve their well-being.
## Technical implemntaion 
- Develop a Flask web application (app.py) to handle routing and serve HTML templates.
- Create HTML templates for the home page and each service (diet plan, BMI calculator, recommendation).
- Implement backend logic for each service, including diet plan generation, BMI calculation, and health issue-based food recommendations.
- Use JavaScript to enhance user interactivity, such as form validation and dynamic content loading.

## Declaration
We confirm that the project showcased here was either developed entirely during the hackathon or underwent significant updates within the hackathon timeframe. We understand that if any plagiarism from online sources is detected, our project will be disqualified, and our participation in the hackathon will be revoked.
## Note:
we have used some bootstrap things to create website as we are new to frontend and we took images source from the google. Also the dataset is not accurate as we created  our own due to lack of bio techincal person in our team.
